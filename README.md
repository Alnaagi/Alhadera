## About

I'm proud to present my graduation project: an app I built using Flutter and Firebase. The app is a student portal with many useful features for college students.

Some of the features are:
- Signing up and logging in with secure authentication
- Viewing your GPA, debts, subjects, and exam results in one place
- Getting general info about the college, such as events, news, and contacts
- Accessing the app from any device with an internet connection

## Built with ❤️

- Flutter for cross-platform development
- Firebase database
- A sprinkle of creativity and a dash of espresso ☕️
