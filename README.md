I'm proud to present my graduation project: an app I built using Flutter and Firebase. The app is a student portal with many useful features for college students.

Some of the features are:
- Signing up and logging in with secure authentication
- Viewing your GPA, debts, subjects, and exam results in one place
- Getting general info about the college, such as events, news, and contacts
- Accessing the app from any device with an internet connection
